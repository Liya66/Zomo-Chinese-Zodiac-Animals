Personal contribution
1. Symmetrical Window Creation
In my script (lines 62-81), I implemented logic to duplicate, horizontally flip, and position layers, creating a symmetrical window effect. This creative feature significantly enhances the visual appeal of the poster.
 

2. The Oilify effect and its control button on the interface
The script (lines 46-48 and in the registration section) includes an optional Oilify effect for the first image layer, introducing a creative aspect to poster design. This effect imparts a sense of fluidity to elements like the ocean and sunshine. I meticulously calibrated the effect’s intensity (too low would be inconspicuous, too high could impede the image creation process) and added a toggle switch in the interface for easy activation. By default, this effect is off to prevent slowing down the image creation process.


3. The Wind Effect
I integrated the Wind effect, a GIMP plug-in, on the lighthouse image (image2, lines 59-60), bringing dynamic movement to the poster, simulating the impact of a strong gale.


4. Adjustable Saturation for the Entire Image on the interface
A loop was introduced in the script (lines 94-96 and in the registration section) to adjust the saturation (with a range from -100 to 100) of all layers. This feature allows users to manipulate the overall color scheme of the image, offering the option to create a vintage-style poster by reducing saturation. The default is 0. 


5. PNG Image with transparency and positioning
Different from the class, I utilized PNG images with transparency for the poster creation. Additionally, precise calculations for layer positioning play a crucial role in the poster's composition, contributing significantly to its aesthetic quality.

Principles of Design
1. Balance
The poster exhibits a harmonious balance. The symmetrical placement of the windows mirrors the structure of the skull, creating visual stability. This symmetry is complemented by the strategic positioning of the skull and lighthouse, which are balanced in terms of visual weight and attention. 
2. Proximity and Alignment
Elements in the poster are thoughtfully grouped to enhance coherence and meaning. The central alignment of key elements like the windows, which symbolize hollow eyes, and the lighthouse, representing a nose, cleverly forms a skull's image. This central alignment unifies the composition, while the consistent color palette of the sun, ocean, background, and skull reinforces this cohesion. 
3. Unity
The poster demonstrates unity through a consistent color scheme and a singular font choice, which creates a cohesive and tidy appearance. The combination of various elements, such as images and text, contributes to a unified design that communicates a clear theme. 
4. Emphasis
A focal point is established with the lighthouse and the ocean imagery positioned centrally within the skull. The lighthouse stands out not only in size but also in its distinctive wind effect, which provides a unique visual texture compared to other elements. 
5. Rhythm
The poster's design guides the viewer's gaze from top to bottom, creating a rhythmic flow that seamlessly transitions between text and imagery. This flow enhances the viewer's engagement with the poster, ensuring that all elements are noticed in a harmonious sequence.

Elements in the Poster
1. The Lighthouse is the most prominent symbol in the book, representing an unattainable ideal or a guiding light in life. It's a constant presence throughout the story, guiding and influencing the characters' thoughts and actions.
2. The Sea: It symbolizes the vastness and unpredictability of life and emotions. The sea is a powerful force in the novel, representing change and the passage of time.
3. The Window: Often referenced in the book, windows symbolize the barrier between the inner world of the characters and the outer world. It represents perspective, how characters see the world and themselves.
4. Flowers: Flowers, particularly in Mrs. Ramsay's garden, are a recurring motif. They symbolize beauty, transience, and the nurturing aspect of Mrs. Ramsay's character. A simple floral design could represent this.
5. The Skull: While a more subtle symbol, the skull in the nursery is a poignant reminder of mortality and the fleeting nature of life, a key theme in the novel.
